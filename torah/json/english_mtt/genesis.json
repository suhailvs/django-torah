            "and the settlers of the land of the one of Kena'an saw the mourning in Goren-Ha'atad and they said, this is a heavy mourning for Mits'rayim, therefore, he called out her title Aveyl-Mitsrayim which is on the other side of the Yarden,",
            "and his sons did to him so, just as he directed them,",
            "and his sons lifted him up unto the land of Kena'an and they buried him in the cave of the field of the Makhpelah, the field for holdings of a grave which Avraham purchased, from Ephron, the one of Hhet, upon the face of Mamre,",
            "and Yoseph turned back from unto Mits'rayim, he and his brothers and all the ones going up with him to bury his father after he buried his father,",
            "and the brothers of Yoseph saw that their father died and they said, will Yoseph hold a grudge to us and return to us all the dysfunction which we yielded to him,",
            "and directed Yoseph saying, your father had directed before his death saying,",
            "In this way you will say to Yoseph, please lift up the offense of your brothers and their failure, given that they yielded you dysfunction, and now please, lift the offense of your servants of the Elohiym of your father, and Yoseph wept in their speaking to him,",
            "and his brothers also walked and they fell to his face and they said, look, we belong to you for servants,",
            "and Yoseph said to them, you will not fear given that I am in the place of Elohiym,",
            "and you had thought dysfunction upon me, Elohiym had thought her for function, on account of it being done like this day, to make the people live abundantly,",
            "and now, you will not fear, I will sustain you and your babies, and he comforted them and he spoke upon their heart,",
            "and Yoseph settled in Mits'rayim, he and the house of his father and Yoseph lived a hundred and ten years,",
            "and Yoseph saw the sons of the third generation belonging to Ephrayim, also the sons of Makhir, the son of Menasheh, they were brought forth upon the knees of Yoseph,",
            "and Yoseph said to his brothers, I am dying and Elohiym will surely visit you, and he will bring you up from this land to the land which he was sworn to Avraham, to Yits'hhaq and to Ya'aqov,",
            "and Yoseph caused the sons of Yisra'eyl to swear saying, Elohiym will surely visit you and you will bring up my bones from this,",
            "and Yoseph died, a son of a hundred and ten years, and they ripened him and he was set in place in the box in Mits'rayim,"
